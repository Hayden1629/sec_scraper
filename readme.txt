This is a simple SEC scraper that scrapes the SEC RSS/JSON feed for the latest filings. 
Currently you can export 13F-HR filings which will give you graphs of change over time.
Keep in mind this information is usually outdated by a few months.
I also would like to retrieve specfic parts of 10K/10Q for rapid analysis.
