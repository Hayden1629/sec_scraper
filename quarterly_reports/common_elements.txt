Given the SEC requirements for 10k reports, tell me what I can expect will be the SAME across all different sectors and companies

# Common Elements Across All 10-K Reports

When scraping 10-K reports from the SEC database, you can rely on certain standardized elements that remain consistent across all companies and sectors due to SEC regulations:

## Standard Document Structure

- **Item Numbers and Titles**: All 10-Ks follow the same numbered item format (Items 1-15) with standardized section titles:
  - Item 1: Business
  - Item 1A: Risk Factors
  - Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments 
  - Item 2: Properties
  - Item 3: Legal Proceedings
  - Item 4: Mine Safety Disclosures (if applicable)
  - Item 5: Market Information
  - Item 6: [Reserved]
  - Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)
  - Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
  - Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
  - Item 9: Changes in Accounting
  - Items 10-14: Corporate governance information
  - Item 15: Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules

- **Required Financial Statements**: All 10-Ks must include:
  - Balance Sheet (for two comparative years)
  - Income Statement (for three comparative years)
  - Cash Flow Statement (for three comparative years)
  - Statement of Shareholders' Equity

## Standardized XBRL Elements

- **Base XBRL Taxonomy**: Core financial concepts use standardized XBRL tags across all filings
- **Document and Entity Information**: Standard tags for company identifiers, filing dates, etc.
- **Context References**: Standardized date/period references in XBRL

## Metadata and Filing Information

- **SEC Header**: Contains standardized company information (CIK number, fiscal year, filing date)
- **EDGAR Submission Headers**: XML metadata about the submission
- **Exhibit Index**: Standardized format for listing attached exhibits

## Required Disclosures

- **Certifications**: Standard CEO/CFO certifications (SOX Section 302 and 906)
- **Auditor's Report**: Required format and content (will be in a standardized format post-2020)
- **Disclosure Controls and Procedures**: Standard language and format
- **Critical Accounting Policies**: Required section with specific elements

## Document Format Standards

- **Machine-Readable Structure**: HTML/XML-based document structure
- **Table Formats**: Standardized table structures for financial data
- **Signature Block**: Standard format for signatures and dates

Even with these standardized elements, be prepared for differences in:
- The specific language used within each required section
- The order and presentation of subsections within each item
- The depth and detail of information provided
- Table structures and formatting preferences
- The use of company-specific XBRL extension taxonomies

These consistent elements provide reliable anchor points for your parser regardless of industry or company size, which can form the foundation of your scraping strategy.
